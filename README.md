# Tower-of-Bramha
There is a story about an Indian temple in Kashi Vishwanath which contains a large room with three time-worn posts in it, surrounded by 64 golden disks. Brahmin priests, acting out the command of an ancient prophecy, have been moving these disks in accordance with the immutable rules of Brahma since that time. The puzzle is therefore also known as the Tower of Brahma puzzle. According to the legend, when the last move of the puzzle is completed, the world will end.   The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:      Only one disk can be moved at a time.     Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.     No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
